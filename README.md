Smart Home Control Prototype
This project is a prototype for a smart home control interface created with Justinmind Prototyper. It simulates a smart home system that allows users to control various functions within their home. The interface consists of four main screens: **Home Screen**, **Voice Command Confirmation**, **Settings Screen**, and **Error Screen**.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a user-friendly interface for a smart home system that integrates both visual controls and voice commands. The prototype demonstrates how users can navigate between screens and interact with various control options, simulating a realistic smart home experience.

Screens
1. Home Screen (Home Screen.png) 
   - This is the main dashboard where users can see an overview of the smart home system.
   - It displays quick access controls for lighting, temperature, and security features.
   - Users can initiate voice commands or enter the settings screen from this screen.

2. Voice Command Confirmation (Voice Command Confirmation.png)  
   - When a user activates a voice command, this screen appears to confirm the command.
   - It provides feedback on whether the voice command was successfully understood.
   - This screen includes options to cancel or proceed with the command.

3. Settings Screen (Settings Screen.png)  
   - This screen allows users to customize their smart home settings, such as setting preferences for temperature, lighting, and other home automation features.
   - Users can manage system preferences, security settings, and notifications.

4. Error Screen (Error Screen.png)
   - This screen is displayed when an error occurs, such as a failed command or an unrecognized input.
   - It provides troubleshooting options and prompts the user to try again or return to the Home Screen.
